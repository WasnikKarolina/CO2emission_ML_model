## Project Overview

The product is a ML algorithm used to predict the future CO2 emission of cars based on past data of the fuel consumption, engine size, number of cylinders and CO2 emission. The model utilizes multiple linear regression to predict the unknown values. The script allows you to visualise the data and outputs the predicted CO2 emission of chosen vehicles after the user inputs values for engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption. 

## Dataset
* The dataset used in this project is sourced from the following URL:

FuelConsumptionCo2.csv

* This dataset includes several features such as:

Engine Size (L) <br> 
Number of Cylinders <br>
Fuel Consumption (L/100 km) <br>
CO2 Emissions (g/km)


# Running the Project
* In order to run the project it is required to install Python along with the following libraries:

numpy <br>
pandas <br>
matplotlib <br>
scikit-learn

* Clone the repository

* Run the main.py file 



## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)
R2 Score
